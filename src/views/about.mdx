# Hey There! ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Shardul Nalegave** from Pune, India currently pursuing my B.E. in Computer Engineering from PICT (Pune Institute of Computer Engineering).

If I had to describe myself in short, I'd say I am an avid learner. I was fortunate enough to study in a school which regularly encouraged us to take part in activities from very different fields/topics. In 6th grade, we were introduced to "Coding & Robotics" club where we were taught the Sprite Programming Language and a curious me wondered if I can make my own version of my favorite game at the time, in Sprite! While I soon realised that it won't really work and that it wasn't the "cannon" way to make a game, it set me on course to explore the amazing world of computers.

<br />

Learning whatever felt interesting, I went from basic Web and App development to Networking, Systems programming and to some extent Graphics and Game development.

While most of this has been hobby learning, now I plan on pursuing a career in this.

<br />

An unordered list of things I'm passionate about:-
- **Full-Stack Web and App Development:** I have experience using MERN, MEVN and Django stacks for Web-Development and using Flutter for cross-platform development. Apart from the widely used stacks, I prefer my own tech-stack consisting of **`Golang + PostgreSQL + GraphQL`** on backend and **`Vite + React`** on frontend.
- **Systems:** While not very experienced in systems programming, I enjoy writing basic kernels and writing emulators for older devices.
- **Networking:** I like fidgeting around with networking protocols and sometimes writing my own very basic ones. It is amazing how once you get computers connected, you can do some really awesome stuff.
- **Distributed Computing:** It is one of the subsets of Computer-Science that excites me the most. I am currently studying Distributed Computing and while the difficulty is high, it's just fun.
- **Open-Source:** I wish to work on and promote open-source practices. Right now, I'm helping promote FOSS through the organisation [FOSS United](https://fossunited.org/). The potential we have as a whole community spread across the globe is amazing.
- **Community Building:** I like to help manage communities and also to help organise and attend events.
